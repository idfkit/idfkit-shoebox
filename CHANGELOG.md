## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Parameter studies. Every scale on the console now carries a quiet **Study**
  action that sweeps that one control across its full range — about twenty
  design-day solves, a second or two of engine — and draws the response as a
  small curve under the control: the summer design day's peak zone temperature
  in the warm pen, the winter day's low in the cold one, with a redline tick
  standing where the control stands now. The desk itself never moves during a
  sweep: the model ends byte-identical to where it started, the address bar and
  every readout hold still, and any real gesture cancels the sweep instantly.
  A study names the desk it was swept against and dims once any *other* control
  moves; dragging the swept control just walks the tick along a curve that is
  still true. Studies are disabled, with the reason stated, while a weather
  file is attached — each sample would be a full annual run — and on priced
  channels, whose controls never reach the engine. A failed sample is drawn as
  a gap in the curve, never an invented point.

- Shareable scheme links. The address bar now carries the whole desk — every
  control off its default, the patch state, and the attached TMYx station with
  its exact year window — as a readable URL fragment
  (`#v1&width=20&wwrS=0.35&stn=725650`), rewritten on every gesture release. A
  **Copy scheme link** action joins the run ledger beside the bundle download,
  and the bundle's manifest now cites the link, so a run can be reproduced
  locally *and* re-solved live from the same download. Opening a link rebuilds
  and re-solves the scheme; a link that cannot be honoured — an unknown key, an
  out-of-range value, a station whose archive cannot be fetched — is refused
  whole with the reason in the status line, never half-loaded. The encoding is
  versioned so links keep working as controls are added.

- Downloadable run bundle. A **Download run bundle** button on the run ledger
  packages the exact IDF and EPW handed to the engine together with the tabular
  report and console log it wrote and a plain-text manifest, so any run can be
  reproduced in a local EnergyPlus rather than taken on faith. A design-day run
  carries no weather file, and the manifest says so instead of shipping a
  fabricated one.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-14

Initial public build of the shoebox: a one-page, client-side EnergyPlus demo
laid out as a drafting sheet, served at
[shoebox.idfkit.com](https://shoebox.idfkit.com).

### Added

- In-browser EnergyPlus engine that re-solves as you work — a design day in
  about 50 ms — alongside an axonometric of the zone and a temperature plate,
  both drawn directly from the `IDFDocument`.
- Model console gathering every control onto one desk, with a balance rail that
  reads the zone air heat balance back off each run.
- Weather location picker over 17,000+ TMYx stations, searchable by city, state
  or WMO number or by nearest to your location; the chosen station's design
  conditions are taken from its DDY, and a full 8,760-hour year replaces the
  design days.
- Window overhang control, projecting shade measured along the host wall's
  outward normal so it holds under rotation.
- Bill of quantities priced from published, non-residential tariffs for North
  America (by state and province) and Europe (by country), reported in both
  cost and carbon.
- Licensing and disclosure section citing the open datasets and npm packages
  behind the page.
