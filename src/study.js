 * The parameter study: one control swept across its own face.

 * A drag is authorship — every frame is the design. A sweep is a question: the
 * desk is solved at each position of one control, the model ends exactly where
 * it started, and the only thing that survives is the curve. This module holds
 * the part of that with no DOM and no engine in it, so the same Node script
 * that checks `applyModel` for idempotence can check the sampling too.

 * Snapped to the step grid, because those are the only values the control can
 * actually hold — a curve through positions the slider cannot reach would be
 * lettering a desk that cannot exist. The current value is kept in the list
 * exactly as it is, not as its nearest gridded neighbour: the study's redline
 * tick stands on the current value, and the one point it must never miss is
 * the one under the tick. A coarse step legitimately collapses the list below
 * the asking count; fewer honest points beat twenty-one invented ones.
